#meteor ionic starter

After looking around to try and find a working starter example of Meteor and Ionic and after hours of integration issues (both are fast moving at the moment are Meteor, Ionic and Angular get better integration) I figured it would be useful for others to benefit from the time i put in.

This is a simple starter example and I will try to keep it up to date and things progress.
