#meteor ionic starter

After looking around to try and find a working starter example of Meteor and Ionic and after hours of integration issues (both are fast moving at the moment are Meteor, Ionic and Angular get better integration) I figured it would be useful for others to benefit from the time i put in.

This is a simple starter example and I will try to keep it up to date and things progress. 

##Steps
1. Create the project **meteor create meteor-ionic-starter**
2. Add the official Meteor Ionic package **meteor add driftyco:ionic**
<<<<<<< HEAD
3. Add the angular package **meteor add urigo:angular**
4. Remove boilerplate code from the .js file and add with new code.
5. Add ng-app to the body tag for the relevant module name used in the .js file. Ensure 'angular-meteor' as added as a dependent module.
6. Using the Android SDK Manager, ensure you have SDK Platform 19 (Android 4.4.2) installed.
7. Install the meteor Android SDK **meteor install-sdk android**, add as a platform **meteor add-platform android** and run **meteor run android**


###Run
